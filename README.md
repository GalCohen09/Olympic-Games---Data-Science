# A little Background
### The Olympic Games are a major international multi-sport event normally held once every four years. 
#### In this project we will show the data we collected about the Olympics from 1960 to 2020.


# We will answer a few questions that interest us, their answers will be displayed in graphs.
+ What is the most common and unusual age to compete in?
+ From which country do the most participants came from?
+ What is the gender split - how many males participated compared to the number of females.
+ The most common age that wins a medal
+ How many men participated compared to the number of women
+ Age variation of male and female athelete over time
+ Variation in height with time
+ Distribution of weight according to year
+ Distribution of height and weight according to sport



## In addition, we made 3 machine learning questions:
#### Question 1 : Predicting whether a country will win medals.
#### Question 2 : Predicting a participant's winnings according to parameters such as weight, height and age.
#### Question 3 :Predicting the amount of women who will participate in the Olympics.
