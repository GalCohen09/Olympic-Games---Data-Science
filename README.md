A little Background
The Olympic Games are a major international multi-sport event normally held once every four years.
In this project we will show the data we collected about the Olympics from 1960 to 2020.
We will answer a few questions that interest us, their answers will be displayed in graphs.
What is the most common and unusual age to compete in?
From which country do the most participants came from?
What is the gender split - how many males participated compared to the number of females.
The most common age that wins a medal
How many men participated compared to the number of women
Age variation of male and female athelete over time
Variation in height with time
Distribution of weight according to year
Distribution of height and weight according to sport
In addition, we made 3 machine learning questions:
Question 1 : Predicting whether a country will win medals.
Question 2 : Predicting a participant's winnings according to parameters such as weight, height and age.
Question 3 :Predicting the amount of women who will participate in the Olympics.
